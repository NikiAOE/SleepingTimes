# Context
I was thinking that recording my sleeping times would be funny for both peers(and the fact I'm ok with them seeing this), my parents, and myself. However, to fufill the requirement of needing to know enough about the topic, I asked myself something interesting: **Why do people willingly sleep late despite being able to sleep earlier?**

## Why do you sleep so late??? - My Personal Experience
Because either:
- I felt like it (wanted to watch yt or something)
- I'm up doing "homework"(I am, don't doubt me please.)

> Because of how tiring school is, I go home and decide not to do work. The procrastination panic monster does not jump at me until late in the afternoon, meaning until then, I get no work done. By the time I start my work, I end up doing it at a really late time, causing the follow times below that follow the couple days I was working on this website and recorded my sleeping times. On average, I sleep around midnight, by choice, usually. Even if I get my work done early, I somehow manage to go on this cancer called "Youtube Shorts" and spend an extra 20 minutes on there, thus ruining any progress I've made in trying to adjust back.

# Then, why do people sleep so late even if they have the power to change it?
**The term for it- Revenge Bedtime Procrastination**
- quite literally, yes, it is the procrastination of going to bed, sacrificing sleeping time, without valid reason

People often procrastinate sleep because of stress during the day, or to catch up on hobbies/things that they were previously unable to do.

Not so surprisingly, **students** are one of the groups that are *more likely* to procrastinate their bedtime.
Sleep Procrasination may be associated with poor self-control/regulation to regulate yourself to go to sleep earlier.

Bedtime Procrastination may show/indicate the presence of procrastination in other aspects of someone's life, which may include, but not limited to:
- chores
- homework

*the following chart describes how people describe their sleep*

It may not be big at first, but it definitely adds up (during summer especially when I procrasinated sleep, the latest I went to was around 3:30 AM, starting from 12 AM from the last day of school)

## Other Factors to consider if this doesn't resonate with you:
People naturally have different circadian rhythms of sleep, some may require more sleep, some may require to sleep at different times to feel rested, etc.
Everyone's circadian rhythm is **unique**, what may work for you may not work for others.

## *Can be called Bedtime Procrastination if it fufills 3 things:*
1. delaying of sleep
2. no reason to stay up
3. knowing that staying up will hurt you

> **In my case, I do show signs of all 3:**
> ----
> 1. I purposely delayed my sleep from 11:30 PM to 12:00 AM
> 2. I didn't have a reason to stay up (YouTube Shorts is not valid)
> 3. If I didn't sleep, I know I would struggle to stay awake the following day
> ----
> During the day, I do feel like I'm stressed out from work and want to relax using a few extra minutes, because... how bad can it be?...

### Please fix your sleep schedule!
**Short Answer:** No.

**Long Answer:** Upon reading all of this, I understand the benefit of not procrastinating sleep, and I will continue to work on it. However, it may take a while to adjust as my thinking and behavior can't be adjusted significantly right away. It requires a lot more consistent work for it to change.
